Option 2 - Events (Ticketmaster, iTunes)
Note that these are only SUGGESTED GUIDELINES. You can alter these in any way, as long as you fulfill all requirements.


•	Select a category you are interested in searching on Ticketmaster — for example, “music” or “sports” or whatever. (Check out the Ticketmaster documentation/website overall for ideas!)
o	Ticketmaster Discovery API: https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/
o	Find your Ticketmaster API key after getting an account on the website, and explore API possibilities: https://developer.ticketmaster.com/api-explorer/


•	Investigate Ticketmaster data. Use that experience to define a class TicketmasterEvent that fulfills requirements and will be useful as a tool in the rest of the program.


•	Investigate iTunes Search API data examples to define a class ITunesMedia that represents one piece of iTunes media (a song, a music video, a movie, could be whatever comes up), which fulfills requirements and will be useful as a tool in the rest of the program.


•	Make a search on Ticketmaster (accessing and caching data).


•	Using that data, create a list of instances of TicketmasterEvent.


•	Each Ticketmaster event probably has a name or a genre (or something else of particular interest).
o	Create an empty master list to hold ALL iTunes results.
o	For each one of those Ticketmaster events (each event’s genre, each event’s name… or whatever you pick), make a search on the iTunes Search API with that term.
o	From the resulting data, create a list of instances of iTunesMedia, and add everything in that list to your master list of iTunes results.


•	Iterate over the list of iTunes results, and create a CSV file called event_media.csv with the following columns and corresponding information:
o	Media name
o	Artist/creator
o	Length in seconds or minutes, if applicable
o	Collection name, if applicable
o	Any other interesting piece of data that might be available for iTunes media (this may depend on what sort of thing your searches turn up!)


Also possible as a nice challenge to make your resulting data more readable:
o	Sort the items by length or by length of title before writing them to the CSV file
